QUESTION: How does carbon dioxide get into a plant?
ANSWER: ['The Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s. The cycle begins by incorporating CO2 from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation.']

QUESTION: How does carbon dioxide get into a plant?
ANSWER: ['Phase 1: Carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle incorporates each CO2 molecule, one at a time, by attaching it to a five-carbon sugar named ribulose bisphosphate (abbreviated RuBP). The enzyme that catalyzes this first step is RuBP carboxylase, or rubisco. (This is the most abundant protein in chloroplasts and is also thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. ) The product of the reaction is a six-carbon intermediate so unstable that it immediately splits in half, forming two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (for each CO2 fixed).']

QUESTION: How does carbon dioxide get into a plant?
ANSWER: ['Carbon dioxide enters the leaf, and oxygen exits, by way of microscopic pores called stomata (singular, stoma; from the Greek, meaning "mouth").']

QUESTION: How does carbon dioxide get into a plant?
ANSWER: ['The CO2 required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata, the pores on the leaf surface (see Figure 10.4).']

QUESTION: abetalipoproteimemia hi, I would like to know if there is any support for those suffering with abetalipoproteinemia? I am not diagnosed but have had many test that indicate I am suffering with this, keen to learn how to get it diagnosed and how to manage, many thanks
ANSWER: ["abetalipoproteinemia: Abetalipoproteinemia is an inherited disorder that affects the absorption of dietary fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins. People affected by this disorder are not able to make certain lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood. Specifically, people with abetalipoproteinemia are missing a group of lipoproteins called beta-lipoproteins. An inability to make beta-lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body's cells and tissues, particularly nerve cells and tissues in the eye. The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of life. They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis); and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. Disturbances in nerve function may cause affected people to eventually develop poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia). Individuals with this condition may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which progressive degeneration of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially a deficiency of vitamin E. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder with approximately 100 cases described worldwide. Mutations in the MTTP gene cause abetalipoproteinemia. The MTTP gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are necessary for the absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and the efficient transport of these substances in the bloodstream. Most of the mutations in the MTTP gene lead to the production of an abnormally short microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which prevents the normal creation of beta-lipoproteins in the body. A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes the nutritional and neurological problems seen in people with abetalipoproteinemia. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

 'Abetalipoproteinemia: Abetalipoproteinemia is a condition characterized by the inability to fully absorb dietary fats, cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins. [1] Signs and symptoms appear in the first few months of life and can include failure to thrive; diarrhea; acanthocytosis; and stool abnormalities. Other features develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system, potentially causing slower intellectual development; poor muscle coordination; progressive ataxia ; and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. [1] [2] Most of the symptoms are due to defects in the absorption and transport of vitamin E. [2] Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the MTTP gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [3] Early diagnosis, high-dose vitamin E therapy, and medium-chain fatty acid supplements may slow the progression of the nervous system abnormalities. Long-term outlook is reasonably good for most affected people who are diagnosed early. If left untreated, the condition can result in early death. [2] The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia usually appear in the first few months of life. They can include: failure to thrive in infancy digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and steatorrhea (foul-smelling stools) abnormal, star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis) nervous system (neurologic) symptoms beginning in childhood such as slower intellectual development; peripheral neuropathy ; poor muscle coordination; ataxia ; and intention tremors eye (ophthalmologic) symptoms such as decreased night and color vision; retinitis pigmentosa in adolescence; and gradual deterioration of vision, often leading to blindness in the fourth decade of life[1][2] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the MTTP gene . The MTTP gene gives the body instructions to make a protein needed for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are necessary for the body to absorb fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A,\xa0D, E and K), and for transporting these substances\xa0in the blood. Mutations in the MTTP\xa0result in a lack of beta-lipoproteins, leading to an inability to absorb and transport these substances. This in turn leads to the nutritional and neurologic problems\xa0in affected people. [1] Abetalipoproteinemia\xa0is inherited in an\xa0 autosomal recessive \xa0manner. [4] This means that to be affected, a person must have a\xa0 mutation \xa0in both copies of the responsible\xa0 gene \xa0in each cell . Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a\xa0 carrier . Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected\xa0and\xa0not be a carrier The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests available for abetalipoproteinemia. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Prenatal testing may be available for pregnancies at increased risk if the mutations in the family have been identified. A nutritionist or other qualified medical professional should be consulted for\xa0specific dietary instruction in people with abetalipoproteinemia. Treatment involves very large doses of vitamin E, as well as large doses of vitamin supplements containing other fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. [3] [2] Several diet changes and/or restrictions are also needed to prevent stomach problems. A low-fat diet may help with digestive symptoms; medium chain triglycerides may be used (under supervision of a specialist) as a source of fat in the diet. [3] Management in adults typically focuses on specific complications associated with the disorder, and depends on the signs and symptoms present. Affected people may need consultations with several other types of specialists, including a lipidologist, gastroenterologist , hepatologist , ophthalmologist , and neurologist . [2] The long-term outlook ( prognosis ) is reasonably good for most people who are diagnosed and treated early. [2] However, how well each person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. [3] Therefore, the prognosis can vary. [5] People with prolonged vitamin deficiency, especially of vitamin E, may develop very limiting ataxia and gait disturbances.\xa0Some people may develop retinal degeneration and blindness.

 'Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome: Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is a rare disease passed down through families. The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through the intestines. Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by a defect in a gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). The defect makes it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins. It is an autosomal recessive condition that more often affects males. Symptoms include: - Balance and coordination difficulties - Curvature of spine - Decreased vision that gets worse over time - Developmental delay - Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy - Muscle weakness - Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10 - Protruding abdomen - Slurred speech - Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools There may be damage to the retina of the eye (retinitis pigmentosa). Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include: - Apolipoprotein B blood test - Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K) - "Burr-cell" malformation of the red cells (acanthocytosis) - Complete blood count (CBC) - Cholesterol studies - Electromyography - Eye exam - Nerve conduction velocity - Stool sample analysis Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the MTP gene. Treatment involves large doses of vitamin supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. People with this condition should talk to a nutritionist. Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This involves: - Limiting fat intake to 5 to 20 grams per day. - Do not eat more than 5 ounces daily (140 grams) of lean meat, fish, or poultry. - Use skim milk instead of whole milk. Supplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider. They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage. How well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. Complications may include: - Blindness - Mental deterioration - Loss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia) Call your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person. High doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.

QUESTION: about thalassemia treatment sir,my friend is suffering from thalassemia ,in that majorly red blood anemia,white blood anemia and the blood is comming out from mouth when she got cough .her condition is very severe .in her body the red ,white blood cells are abscent .so that blood transfusion is doing for every 16-20days.then in the recent days the blood also comming out from mouth please tell me where can i get the treatment for this disease .we can travel around the world for treatment please reply me as soon as possible. thank you sir.
ANSWER: ['Thalassemia (Treatment): Treatment for thalassemia depends on which type you have and how severe it is. Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling.'
 'Sickle beta thalassemia (Treatment): Treatment for sickle beta thalassemia is supportive and usually depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person. It is generally recommended that all affected people drink plenty of water; avoid climate extremes, activities that lead to inflammation and extreme fatigue; and stay up-to-date on all immunizations. Because sickle beta thalassemia is associated with a variety of health problems, affected people are usually followed closely by their healthcare provider with regular physical examinations that may include specialized laboratory tests and imaging studies (i.e. chest X-ray, transcranial doppler ultrasound, ECG). Blood transfusions may be prescribed on a regular basis for affected people with a history of or risk factors for stroke and other specific health problems, such as pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea, a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of sickle cell disease, can decrease the frequency and severity of pain episodes; reduce the need of blood transfusions; and increase life span.

 'Chemotherapy: The term chemotherapy is used to describe cancer-killing drugs. Chemotherapy may be used to: - Cure the cancer - Shrink the cancer - Prevent the cancer from spreading - Relieve symptoms the cancer may be causing HOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN Depending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy drugs may be given different ways, including: - Injections or shots into the muscles - Injections or shots under the skin - Into an artery - Into a vein (intravenous, or IV) - Pills taken by mouth - Shots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain When chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery. There are many types of catheters, including: - Central venous catheter - Central venous catheter with a port - Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) A central line can stay in the body over a long period of time. It will need to be flushed\xa0on a weekly to monthly basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line. Different chemotherapy drugs may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose. Often, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital. Some people are able to receive chemotherapy in their home. If home chemotherapy is given, home health nurses will help with the medicine and IVs.\xa0The person\xa0getting the chemotherapy\xa0and their family members will receive special training. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY The different types of chemotherapy include: - Standard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells. - Targeted treatment and immunotherapy zero in on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY Because these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment. As a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract. When this damage occurs, there can be side effects. Some people who receive chemotherapy: - Are more likely to have infections - Become tired more easily - Bleed too much, even during everyday activities - Feel pain or numbness from nerve damage - Have a dry mouth, mouth sores, or swelling in the mouth - Have a poor appetite or lose weight - Have an upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea - Lose their hair - Have problems with thinking and memory ("chemo brain") Side effects of chemotherapy depend on many things, including the type of cancer and which drugs are being used. Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects. Your health care provider will explain what you can do at home to prevent or treat side effects. These measures include: - Being careful with pets and other animals to avoid catching infections from them - Eating enough calories and protein to keep your weight up - Preventing bleeding, and what to do if bleeding occurs - Practicing safe eating\xa0and drinking habits - Washing your hands often with soap and water You will need to have follow-up visits with your provider during and after chemotherapy. Blood tests and imaging tests, such as x-rays, MRI, CT, or PET scans will be done to: - Monitor how well the chemotherapy is working - Watch for damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, and other parts of the body Updated by: Todd Gersten, MD, Hematology/Oncology, Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute, Wellington, FL.

 "Anemia (Treatment): Anemia treatment depends on the cause. - Iron deficiency anemia. Treatment for this form of anemia usually involves taking iron supplements and making changes to your diet. If the underlying cause of iron deficiency is loss of blood - other than from menstruation - the source of the bleeding must be located and stopped. This may involve surgery. - Vitamin deficiency anemias. Treatment for folic acid and B-12 deficiency involves dietary supplements and increasing these nutrients in your diet. If your digestive system has trouble absorbing vitamin B-12 from the food you eat, you may need vitamin B-12 shots. At first, you may receive the shots every other day. Eventually, you'll need shots just once a month, which may continue for life, depending on your situation. - Anemia of chronic disease. There's no specific treatment for this type of anemia. Doctors focus on treating the underlying disease. If symptoms become severe, a blood transfusion or injections of synthetic erythropoietin, a hormone normally produced by your kidneys, may help stimulate red blood cell production and ease fatigue. - Aplastic anemia. Treatment for this anemia may include blood transfusions to boost levels of red blood cells. You may need a bone marrow transplant if your bone marrow is diseased and can't make healthy blood cells. - Anemias associated with bone marrow disease. Treatment of these various diseases can include medication, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. - Hemolytic anemias. Managing hemolytic anemias includes avoiding suspect medications, treating related infections and taking drugs that suppress your immune system, which may be attacking your red blood cells. Depending on the severity of your anemia, a blood transfusion or plasmapheresis may be necessary. Plasmapheresis is a type of blood-filtering procedure. In certain cases, removal of the spleen can be helpful. - Sickle cell anemia. Treatment for this anemia may include the administration of oxygen, pain-relieving drugs, and oral and intravenous fluids to reduce pain and prevent complications. Doctors also may recommend blood transfusions, folic acid supplements and antibiotics. A bone marrow transplant may be an effective treatment in some circumstances. A cancer drug called hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) also is used to treat sickle cell anemia. - Thalassemia. This anemia may be treated with blood transfusions, folic acid supplements, medication, removal of the spleen (splenectomy), or a blood and bone marrow stem cell transplant."]

QUESTION: Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical
ANSWER: ['What is Absence seizure?: An absence seizure is the term given to a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain.'
 'Absence seizure: An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 6 to 12. In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates). They may occur with other types of seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may: - Occur many times a day - Occur for weeks to months before being noticed - Interfere with school and learning - Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures. During the seizure, the person may: - Stop walking and start again a few seconds later - Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later The person usually does not fall during the seizure. Right after the seizure, the person is usually: - Wide awake - Thinking clearly - Unaware of the seizure Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include: - Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing - Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system. An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures. Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.

 "Absence seizure: Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than in adults. Someone having an absence seizure may look like he or she is staring blankly into space for a few seconds. Then, there is a quick return to a normal level of alertness. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. Absence seizures usually can be controlled with anti-seizure medications. Some children who have them also develop other seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens. An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include: - Sudden stop in motion without falling - Lip smacking - Eyelid flutters - Chewing motions - Finger rubbing - Small movements of both hands Afterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they're so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child's inability to pay attention or that a child is often daydreaming. Contact your doctor: - The first time you notice a seizure - If this is a new type of seizure - If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medication Contact 911 or emergency services in your area: - If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours - activities such as eating or moving without awareness - or prolonged confusion, possible symptoms of a condition called absence status epilepticus - After any seizure lasting more than five minutes Many children appear to have a genetic predisposition to absence seizures. In general, seizures are caused by abnormal electrical impulses from nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The brain's nerve cells normally send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them. In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern. People who have seizures may also have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another (neurotransmitters). Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including: - Age. Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of 4 and 14. - Sex. Absence seizures are more common in girls. - Family members who have seizures. Nearly half of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures. Your doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include: - Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern. - Brain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Because your child will need to hold still for long periods, talk with your doctor about the possible use of sedation. Your doctor likely will start at the lowest dose of anti-seizure medication possible and increase the dosage as needed to control the seizures. Children may be able to taper off anti-seizure medications, under a doctor's supervision, after they've been seizure-free for two years. Drugs prescribed for absence seizure include: - Ethosuximide (Zarontin). This is the drug most doctors start with for absence seizures. In most cases, seizures respond well to this drug. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, trouble sleeping, hyperactivity. - Valproic acid (Depakene). Girls who continue to need medication into adulthood should discuss potential risks of valproic acid with their doctors. Valproic acid has been associated with higher risk of birth defects in babies, and doctors advise women against using it during pregnancy or while trying to conceive. Doctors may recommend the use of valproic acid in children who have both absence and grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures. - Lamotrigine (Lamictal). Some studies show this drug to be less effective than ethosuximide or valproic acid, but it has fewer side effects. Side effects may include rash and nausea. Dietary therapy Following a diet that's high in fat and low in carbohydrates, known as a ketogenic diet, can improve seizure control. This is used only if traditional medications fail to control the seizures. This diet isn't easy to maintain, but is successful at reducing seizures for some people. Variations on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, such as the glycemic index and modified Atkins diets, though less effective, aren't as restrictive as the ketogenic diet and may also provide benefit. Additional options Here are other steps you might take to help with seizure control: - Take medication correctly. Don't adjust the dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly if you have another seizure. - Ask your doctor about driving or recreation restrictions. Someone with a seizure disorder will have to be seizure-free for reasonable lengths of time (intervals vary from state to state) before being able to drive. Don't bathe or swim unless someone else is nearby to help if needed."
 "Seizures: A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. It can cause changes in your behavior, movements or feelings, and in levels of consciousness. If you have two or more seizures or a tendency to have recurrent seizures, you have epilepsy. There are many types of seizures, which range in severity. Seizure types vary by where and how they begin in the brain. Most seizures last from 30 seconds to two minutes. A seizure that lasts longer than five minutes is a medical emergency. Seizures are more common than you might think. Seizures can happen after a stroke, a closed head injury, an infection such as meningitis or another illness. Many times, though, the cause of a seizure is unknown. Most seizure disorders can be controlled with medication, but management of seizures can still have a significant impact on your daily life. The good news is you can work with your health care professional to balance seizure control and medication side effects. Seizure care at Mayo Clinic With a seizure, signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary depending on the type of seizure. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion - A staring spell - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs - Loss of consciousness or awareness - Cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where abnormal brain activity begins. Seizures may also be classified as unknown onset, if how the seizure began isn't known. Focal seizures Focal seizures result from abnormal electrical activity in one area of your brain. Focal seizures can occur with or without loss of consciousness: - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. You may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. These seizures may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound, but you don't lose consciousness. These seizures may also result in the involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include: - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or by subtle body movements, such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes. - Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. - A second seizure follows immediately. - You have a high fever. - You're experiencing heat exhaustion. - You're pregnant. - You have diabetes. - You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Nerve cells (neurons) in the brain create, send and receive electrical impulses, which allow the brain's nerve cells to communicate. Anything that disrupts these communication pathways can lead to a seizure. The most common cause of seizures is epilepsy. But not every person who has a seizure has epilepsy. Sometimes seizures happen because of: - High fever, which can be associated with an infection such as meningitis - Lack of sleep - Low blood sodium (hyponatremia), which can happen with diuretic therapy - Medications, such as certain pain relievers, antidepressants or smoking cessation therapies, that lower the seizure threshold - Head trauma that causes an area of bleeding in the brain - Stroke - Brain tumor - Illegal or recreational drugs, such as amphetamines or cocaine - Alcohol abuse, during times of withdrawal or extreme intoxication After a seizure, your doctor will thoroughly review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to determine the cause of your seizure and evaluate how likely it is that you'll have another one. Tests may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities and mental function to determine if you have a problem with your brain and nervous system. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions, blood sugar levels or electrolyte imbalances. - Lumbar puncture. If your doctor suspects an infection as the cause of a seizure, you may need to have a sample of cerebrospinal fluid removed for testing. - An electroencephalogram (EEG). In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain, which shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may reveal a pattern that tells doctors whether a seizure is likely to occur again. EEG testing may also help your doctor exclude other conditions that mimic epilepsy as a reason for your seizure. Depending on the details of your seizures, this test may be done as an outpatient in the clinic, overnight at home with an ambulatory device or over a few nights in the hospital. - Computerized tomography (CT). A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might cause a seizure, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could lead to seizures. - Positron emission tomography (PET). A PET scan uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain that happens during a seizure. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. This test is usually done in a hospital with overnight EEG recording. Not everyone who has one seizure will have another one, and because a seizure can be an isolated incident, your doctor may not decide to start treatment until you've had more than one. The optimal goal in seizure treatment is to find the best possible therapy to stop seizures, with the fewest side effects. Medication Treatment for seizures often involves the use of anti-seizure medications. Several options exist for anti-seizure medications. The goal is to find the medicine that works best for you and that causes the fewest side effects. In some cases, your doctor might recommend more than one medication. Finding the right medication and dosage can be complex. Your doctor will consider your condition, your frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure the anti-epileptic medications won't interact with them. Surgery and other therapies If anti-seizure medications aren't effective, other treatments may be an option: - Surgery. The goal of surgery is to stop seizures from happening. Surgeons locate and remove the area of your brain where seizures begin. Surgery works best for people who have seizures that always originate in the same place in their brains. - Vagus nerve stimulation. A device implanted underneath the skin of your chest stimulates the vagus nerve in your neck, sending signals to your brain that inhibit seizures. With vagus nerve stimulation, you may still need to take medication, but you may be able to lower the dose. - Responsive neurostimulation. During responsive neurostimulation, a device implanted on the surface of your brain or within brain tissue can detect seizure activity and deliver an electrical stimulation to the detected area to stop the seizure. - Deep brain stimulation. Doctors implant electrodes within certain areas of your brain to produce electrical impulses that regulate abnormal brain activity. The electrodes attach to a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin of your chest, which controls the amount of stimulation produced. - Dietary therapy. Following a diet that's high in fat and low in carbohydrates, known as a ketogenic diet, can improve seizure control. Variations on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, such as the low glycemic index and modified Atkins diets, though less effective, aren't as restrictive as the ketogenic diet and may provide benefit. Pregnancy and seizures Women who've had previous seizures typically are able to have healthy pregnancies. Birth defects related to certain medications can sometimes occur. In particular, valproic acid - one possible medication for generalized seizures - has been associated with cognitive deficits and neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. The American Academy of Neurology recommends that women avoid using valproic acid during pregnancy because of risks to the baby. Discuss these risks with your doctor. Because of the risk of birth defects and because pregnancy can alter medication levels, preconception planning is particularly important for women who've had seizures. In some cases, it may be appropriate to change the dose of seizure medication before or during pregnancy. Medications may be switched in rare cases. Contraception and anti-seizure medications Some anti-seizure medications can alter the effectiveness of birth control (oral contraceptive) medication. If contraception is a high priority, check with your doctor to evaluate whether your medication interacts with your oral contraceptive, and if other forms of contraception need to be considered. Here are some steps you can take to help with seizure control: - Take medication correctly. Don't adjust the dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly if you have another seizure. - Be active. Exercising and being active may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression. Make sure to drink enough water and rest if you get tired during exercise. - Make healthy life choices. Managing stress, limiting alcoholic beverages and avoiding cigarettes all factor in to a healthy lifestyle. Personal safety Seizures don't usually result in serious injury, but if you have recurrent seizures, injury is a possibility. These steps can help you avoid injury during a seizure: - Take care near water. Don't swim alone or relax in a boat without someone nearby. - Wear a helmet for protection during activities such as bike riding or sports participation. - Take showers instead of baths, unless someone is near you. - Modify your furnishings. Pad sharp corners, buy furniture with rounded edges and choose chairs that have arms to keep you from falling off the chair. Consider carpet with thick padding to protect you if you do fall. - Display seizure first-aid tips in a place where people can easily see them. Include any important phone numbers there, too. Seizure first aid It's helpful to know what to do if you witness someone having a seizure. If you're at risk of having seizures in the future, pass this information along to family, friends and co-workers so that they know what to do if you have a seizure. To help someone during a seizure, take these steps: - Carefully roll the person onto one side - Place something soft under his or her head - Loosen tight neckwear - Avoid putting your fingers or other objects in the person's mouth - Don't try to restrain someone having a seizure - Clear away dangerous objects, if the person is moving - Stay with the person until medical personnel arrive - Observe the person closely so that you can provide details on what happened - Time the seizure - Stay calm"
 "Epilepsy juvenile absence: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1941 Disease definition Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures , frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks. Epidemiology The incidence of JAE is still unknown but it accounts for approximately 2-3% of patients with adult epilepsy in general, and about 8-10% of patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). No sex predominance has been observed. Clinical description JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures (only one or a few absences daily; 100% of cases), frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS; 80%) and sporadic myoclonic jerks (20%). The seizures onset is typically between 9 and 13 years of age and it manifests as a ''staring spell'' that can be accompanied by atonic postures such as drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking. GTCS and myoclonic seizures often occur 1-10 years after the absence seizure onset. Patients with JAE usually develop normally, although uncontrolled absence seizures may have an impact on their ability to learn at school. Etiology The exact etiology of JAE is still elusive. However, genetic mutations for voltage-gated sodium channels ( CACNB4 gene (2q22-q23)), potassium channels ( CLCN2 gene (3q27.1)), and EFHC1 (6p12.3) may be involved in a subset of patients. Moreover, different mutations have been found in genes for GABA receptors (ligand ion channels), specifically in the GABRA1 gene (5q34). Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on the clinical features and on electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded awake and during sleep, that displays a generalized 3-4 Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Jeavons syndrome (see these terms). Genetic counseling The transmission is still unknown although an increased risk for first degree related parents to develop JME may exist. Management and treatment The antiepileptic drugs of choice are valproic acid (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG). In cases where VPA deals with only partial seizure control, add-on of LTG (GTCS) or ethosuximide (absence seizures) can be beneficial. Prognosis Prognosis of JAE is usually favorable with good therapy responsiveness. Generally, seizure freedom can be achieved with antiepileptic medication in 62-84% of all patients with JAE. However, the occurrence of GTCS predicts a worse prognosis. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency).

 'Seizures: A seizure is the physical findings or changes in behavior that occur after an episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The term "seizure" is often used interchangeably with "convulsion." During convulsions a person has uncontrollable shaking that is rapid and rhythmic, with the muscles contract and relax repeatedly. There are many different types of seizures. Some have mild symptoms without shaking. It may be hard to tell if someone is having a seizure. Some seizures only cause a person to have staring spells. These may go unnoticed. Specific symptoms depend on which part of the brain is involved. Symptoms occur suddenly and may include: - Brief blackout followed by a period of confusion (the person cannot remember for a short time) - Changes in behavior, such as picking at one\'s clothing - Drooling or frothing at the mouth - Eye movements - Grunting and snorting - Loss of bladder or bowel control - Mood changes, such as sudden anger, unexplainable fear, panic, joy, or laughter - Shaking of the entire body - Sudden falling - Tasting a bitter or metallic flavor - Teeth clenching - Temporary stop in breathing - Uncontrollable muscle spasms with twitching and jerking limbs Symptoms may stop after a few seconds or minutes, or continue for up to 15 minutes. They rarely continue longer. The person may have warning symptoms before the attack, such as: - Fear or anxiety - Nausea - Vertigo (feeling as if you are spinning or moving) - Visual symptoms (such as flashing bright lights, spots, or wavy lines before the eyes) Seizures of all types are caused by disorganized and sudden electrical activity in the brain. Causes of seizures can include: - Abnormal levels of sodium or glucose in the blood - Brain infection, including meningitis - Brain injury that occurs to the baby during labor or childbirth - Brain problems that occur before birth (congenital brain defects) - Brain tumor (rare) - Drug abuse - Electric shock - Epilepsy - Fever (particularly in young children) - Head injury - Heart disease - Heat illness (heat intolerance) - High fever - Phenylketonuria (PKU), which can cause seizures in infants - Poisoning - Street drugs, such as angel dust (PCP), cocaine, amphetamines - Stroke - Toxemia of pregnancy - Toxin buildup in the body due to liver or kidney failure - Very high blood pressure (malignant hypertension) - Venomous bites and stings (snake bite) - Withdrawal from alcohol or certain medicines after using for a long time Sometimes, no cause can be found. This is called idiopathic seizures. They are usually seen in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. There may be a family history of epilepsy or seizures. If seizures continue repeatedly after the underlying problem is treated, the condition is called epilepsy. Most seizures stop by themselves. But during a seizure, the person can be hurt or injured. When a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect the person from injury: - Try to prevent a fall. Lay the person on the ground in a safe area. Clear the area of furniture or other sharp objects. - Cushion the person\'s head. - Loosen tight clothing, especially around the neck. - Turn the person on their side. If vomiting occurs, this helps make sure that the vomit is not inhaled into the lungs. - Look for a medical ID bracelet with seizure instructions. - Stay with the person until he or she recovers, or until professional medical help arrives. Things friends and family members should NOT do: - DO NOT restrain (try to hold down) the person. - DO NOT place anything between the person\'s teeth during a seizure (including your fingers). - DO NOT move the person unless they are in danger or near something hazardous. - DO NOT try to make the person stop convulsing. They have no control over the seizure and are not aware of what is happening at the time. - DO NOT give the person anything by mouth until the convulsions have stopped and the person is fully awake and alert. - DO NOT start CPR unless the seizure has clearly stopped and the person is not breathing or has no pulse. If a baby or child has a seizure during a high fever, cool the child slowly with lukewarm water. DO NOT place the child in a cold bath. Call your child\'s health care provider and ask what you should do next. Also, ask if it is OK to give the child acetaminophen (Tylenol) once he or she is awake. Call 911 or your local emergency number if: - This is the first time the person has had a seizure - A seizure lasts more than 2 to 5 minutes - The person does not awaken or have normal behavior after a seizure - Another seizure starts soon after a seizure ends - The person had a seizure in water - The person is pregnant, injured, or has diabetes - The person does not have a medical ID bracelet (instructions explaining what to do) - There is anything different about this seizure compared to the person\'s usual seizures Report all seizures to the person\'s provider. The provider may need to adjust or change the person\'s medicines. A person who has had a new or severe seizure is usually seen in a hospital emergency room. The provider will try to diagnose the type of seizure based on the symptoms. Tests will be done to rule out other medical conditions that cause seizures or similar symptoms. This may include fainting, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke, panic attacks, migraine headaches, sleep disturbances, among others. Tests that may be ordered include: - Blood tests - CT scan of the head or MRI of the head - EEG (usually not in the emergency room) - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) Further testing is needed if a person has: - A new seizure without a clear cause - Epilepsy (to make sure the person is taking the right amount of medicine) Updated by: Amit M.

 'Tranebjaerg Svejgaard syndrome: Tranebjaerg Svejgaard syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by intellectual disability , seizures and psoriasis. It has been reported in four male cousins. The underlying genetic cause of the condition is currently unknown; however, it is thought to be inherited in an X-linked manner. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include medications to control seizures. [1] [2] [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

 'Absence of the Septum Pellucidum: The septum pellucidum (SP) is a thin membrane located at the midline of the brain between the two cerebral hemispheres, or halves of the brain.. It is connected to the corpus callosum -- a collection of nerve fibers that connect the cerebral hemispherers. \xa0This rare abnormality accompanies various malformations of the brain that affect intelligence, behavior, and the neurodevelopmental process, and seizures may occur. Children who are born without this membrane and also have other abnormalities--pituitary deficiencies and abnormal development of the optic disk--have a disorder known as septo-optic dysplasia. \xa0More information about this condition can be located at the NINDS Septo-Optic Dysplasia Information Page. Absence of the SP alone is not a disorder but is instead a characteristic noted in children with septo-optic dysplasia or other developmental anomalies. When the absence of the septum pellucidum is part of septo-optic dysplasia, the prognosis varies according to the presence and severity of associated symptoms. \xa0By itself, absence of the septum pellucidum is not life-threatening.'
 'Absence of septum pellucidum: The absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare condition that affects the structure of the brain. Specifically, a thin membrane called the septum pellucidum is missing from its normal position in the middle of the brain. [1] When it is missing, symptoms may include learning difficulties, behavioral changes, seizures , and changes in vision. Absence of the septum pellucidum is not typically seen as an isolated finding. Instead, absence of the septum pellucidum is associated with other conditions such as septo-optic dysplasia. [2] Treatment options for the condition vary depending on the underlying disorder. Diagnosis of absence of the septum pellucidum can be made through imaging such as an MRI. Symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum typically present during childhood, but a diagnosis can also be made before an individual is born (prenatally). [3] If an individual is found to be missing the septum pellucidum, a search for \xa0an underlying disorder should be made. The symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum may vary, and it may be difficult to determine which symptoms are due to \xa0the \xa0underlying disorder and which ones are due to absence of the septum pellucidum.\xa0 Symptoms that are common among people with absence of the septum pellucidum include learning disabilities, seizures , and behavioral changes. The septum pellucidum provides information to the rest of the body about how the body is doing. This information may include whether or not the body has received enough sleep or food, or whether the environment is safe. [4] Therefore, an absence of the septum pellucidum may cause an individual to feel hungry even when they are not or tired when they have had enough sleep. Some people with absence of the septum pellucidum do not grow very tall or have a high body mass index (BMI). This means that they have a higher weight than is typical for their height. [5] Absence of the septum pellucidum can be caused by multiple factors depending on the underlying condition. Some people are born with or develop hydrocephalus , or a fluid buildup in the brain. If this condition goes untreated, the excess fluid can disintegrate the septum pellucidum. Absence of the septum pellucidum can also be the result of a genetic condition that is present in a baby at birth. Additionally, the septum pellucidum is connected to another brain structure called the corpus callosum , which is responsible for sending information between the two halves of the brain. Some people are born with a missing corpus callosum. People with a missing corpus callosum will also have a missing septum pellucidum. [1]\xa0 The long-term outlook or prognosis for individuals affected by absence of the septum pellucidum varies depending on the underlying cause of the condition. Some of the symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum may be treated. For example, medications can be used to help relieve seizures or treat any behavioral changes. Growth hormone may be prescribed for individuals who have a high body mass index and are short in stature. By itself, absence of the septum pellucidum is not life-threatening. However, the prognosis of certain conditions that cause absence of the septum pellucidum may differ. [1] [5]'
 "Febrile Seizures: Febrile seizures are convulsions or seizures \xa0in infants or small children that are brought on by a fever. Most often during a febrile seizure, a child loses consciousness and shakes uncontrollably.\xa0 Less commonly, a child becomes rigid or has twitches in only a portion of the body. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two; some can be as brief as a few seconds, while others may last for more than 15 minutes. Approximately one in every 25 children will have at least one febrile seizure. \xa0Febrile seizures usually occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, with the risk peaking in the second year of life. The older a child is when the first febrile seizure occurs, the less likely that child is to have more. \xa0A few factors appear to boost a child's risk of having recurrent febrile seizures, including young age (less than 18 months) during the first seizures and having immediate family members with a history of febrile seizures. A child who has a febrile seizure usually doesn't need to be hospitalized. If the seizure is prolonged or is accompanied by a serious infection, or if the source of the infection cannot be determined, a doctor may recommend that the child be hospitalized for observation. Prolonged daily use of anti-seizure medicines is usually not recommended because of their potential for harmful side effects. Children especially prone to febrile seizures may be treated with medication when they have a fever to lower the risk of having another febrile seizure. The vast majority of febrile seizures are short and harmless. There is no evidence that short febrile seizures cause brain damage. Multiple or prolonged seizures are a risk factor for epilepsy but most children who experience febrile seizures do not go on to develop the reoccurring seizures that re characteristic of epilepsy. Certain children who have febrile seizures face an increased risk of developing epilepsy. These children include those who have a febrile seizure that lasts longer than 10 minutes, who have febrile seizures that are lengthy or affect only one part of the body, or experience seizures that reoccur within 24 hours.."]

QUESTION: adrenoleukodystrophy A child I have been asked to work with has been diagnosed with this condition.I am so far unable to find info pertaining to this illness. Can you help??
ANSWER: ['Adrenoleukodystrophy (Treatment): Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition.'
 "What is Adrenoleukodystrophy?: X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected. People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD. While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35. Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of AMN but almost never will develop symptoms seen in boys the X-ALD. X-ALD should not be confused with neonatal adrenoleukodsystrophy, which is a disease of newborns and young infants and belongs to the group of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders."
 'What is Adrenoleukodystrophy?: Adrenoleukodystrophy describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. These disorders are passed down (inherited) in families.'
 'Adrenoleukodystrophy (Treatment): Adrenal function must be tested periodically in all patients with ALD. Treatment with adrenal hormones can be lifesaving. Symptomatic and supportive treatments for ALD include physical therapy, psychological support, and special education. Recent evidence suggests that a mixture of oleic acid and erucic acid, known as "Lorenzo\'s Oil," administered to boys with X-ALD prior to symptom onset can prevent or delay the appearance of the childhood cerebral form \xa0It is not known whether Lorenzo\'s Oil will have any beneficial effects in AMN. \xa0Furthermore, Lorenzo\'s Oil has no beneficial effect in symptomatic boys with X-ALD. \xa0Bone marrow transplantations can provide long-term benefit to boys who have early evidence of the childhood cerebral form of X-ALD, but the procedure carries risk of mortality and morbidity and is not recommended for those whose symptoms are already severe or who have the adult-onset or neonatal forms.'
 'Adrenoleukodystrophy: Adrenoleukodystrophy describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. These disorders are passed down (inherited) in families. Adrenoleukodystrophy is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait. It affects mostly males, although some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races. The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body. There are 3 major categories of disease: - Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8) - Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life - Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones Childhood cerebral type symptoms include: - Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements - Crossed eyes - Handwriting that gets worse - Difficulty at school - Difficulty understanding what people are saying - Hearing loss - Hyperactivity - Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis - Seizures - Swallowing difficulties - Visual impairment or blindness Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include: - Difficulty controlling urination - Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness - Problems with thinking speed and visual memory Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include: - Coma - Decreased appetite - Increased skin color - Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting) - Muscle weakness - Vomiting Tests for this condition include: - Blood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland - Chromosome study to look for changes (mutations) in the ABCD1 gene - MRI of the head Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones. A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition. The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs. The other forms of this disease are milder. These complications can occur: - Adrenal crisis - Vegetative state Call your health care provider if: - Your child develops symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy - Your child has X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and is getting worse Genetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition. Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is also available. It is done by testing cells from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These tests look for either a known genetic change in the family or for very long chain fatty acid levels.

 'X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (Summary): X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited \xa0condition that occurs\xa0mostly in males.\xa0 The condition mainly affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands (small glands located on top of each kidney). People with this disorder often have progressive destruction of the fatty covering ( myelin ) that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord. They may also have a shortage of certain hormones caused by damage to the outer layer of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex), called adrenocortical insufficiency.\xa0 X-ALD is caused by mutations in the\xa0 gene . These gene mutations\xa0cause a\xa0shortage (deficiency) of a protein \xa0called adrenoleukodystrophy protein\xa0(ALDP).\xa0 A\xa0deficiency of this protein\xa0leads to\xa0an abnormally high level of fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) to build up in the body.\xa0 High levels of VLCFA\xa0may be toxic to the adrenal cortex and myelin.\xa0\xa0 There are\xa0several forms\xa0of X-ALD including: a childhood cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)\xa0type, and an adrenal insufficiency-only\xa0type. Another form of ALD is occasionally seen in women who are carriers of the condition [1] A specific treatment for X-ALD is not currently\xa0available, but eating a diet low in\xa0VLCFA and taking special oils can lower the blood levels of VLCFA.\xa0 Bone marrow transplantation (BMT)\xa0may be\xa0an option for boys and adolescents in early stages who have evidence of brain involvement on MRI .

QUESTION: Anal Fissure I may have a couple anal fissures and looking to speak with someone to get some information and support.
ANSWER: ["Anal fissure (Complications): Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure."
 "Do you have information about Nutritional Support: Summary : Nutritional support is therapy for people who cannot get enough nourishment by eating or drinking. You may need it if you - Can't swallow - Have problems with your appetite - Are severely malnourished - Can't absorb nutrients through your digestive system You receive nutritional support through a needle or catheter placed in your vein or with a feeding tube, which goes into your stomach."
 "Anal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement - Itching or irritation around the anus - A visible crack in the skin around the anus - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools - Constipation and straining during bowel movements - Chronic diarrhea - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer - HIV - Tuberculosis - Syphilis - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why. - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area. - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing. - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth. - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing. - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment. - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one. - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor."
